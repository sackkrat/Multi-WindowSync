# MultiWindowSync-PyQt
  * Windows GUI application developed using `PyQt5`.
  * It demonstrates the synchronization of multiple windows using `pyqtSignal`. <br>
  * Inspired by the [work](https://twitter.com/_nonfigurativ_/status/1727322594570027343) of Bj√∏rn Staal.

## Contributing
Contributions to the project are welcome. Currently working on:
* Expanding the environment to 3D using PyOpenGL.
* Fix the bug where the parent image window always moves the image along with it for ref to other windows even if `Move With Window` is unchecked.
